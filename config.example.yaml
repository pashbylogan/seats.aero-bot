# Points valuation settings
# Used to calculate cents per point (CPP)
valuation:
  # Provide a baseline cash price per flight (in USD) to calculate CPP
  # CPP = (Cash Price - Taxes) / Miles × 100
  #
  # NOTE: Currently this must be manually set. In the future, this could be
  # automated by integrating with flight price APIs, but most require partner
  # approval or paid subscriptions.
  #
  # To find cash prices, check:
  #   - Google Flights: https://www.google.com/travel/flights
  #   - Kayak: https://www.kayak.com/flights
  #   - ITA Matrix: https://matrix.itasoftware.com/
  baseline_cash_price: null
  # Example: baseline_cash_price: 350.00

  # Optional: CPP threshold - only show flights above this value
  # This helps filter for good deals
  min_cpp: 0.01  # 1 cent per point minimum

# Output settings
